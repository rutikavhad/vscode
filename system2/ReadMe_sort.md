#String sorting in C#

1. Sorting by reading a file (sortbyfile)
2. Sorting from an in-memory array (sortbyarray)

I use a string tokenization and string comparison to sort a list to ascending order



Sorting/
|--sortsting.c
|--test.text  # 
|__ReadMe_sort.md

#HOW TO RUN#
make sure you change a path test.text file in c program
```bash
gcc sortstring.c -o sort
./sort
```
