# How to run this program

# Brain program

#compile
'''bash
gcc urecv.c -o urecv
gcc usend.c -o usend
gcc brain.c -o brain

#run one by one
'''bash
./urecv
./brain
./usend



# program 1

## this program take as input config file 
##inside file have a ear mouth size and port number
## current system size=1 
## if want to run as two system want to change port as file in urecv.c and usend.c file


#baby0:

#modify my old brain program only:

# first compile all:
'''bash
gcc urecv.c -o urecv
gcc baby0.c -o baby0
gcc usend.c -o usend


# then run:
'''bash
./urecv
./baby0 params.config
./usend


# inside  of config file"
'''bash
EAR_PORT=6000
MOUTH_PORT=5000
REMOTE_IP=127.0.0.1
SELF_SIZE=1
BUFLEN=1022


#change as per ear and mouth port 


#program 2:

#baby1.c

## this program send massage as chunk as 1024 as limit one time also we can set our limit


#compile first:
'''bash
gcc baby1.c -o baby1

#run on 1st terminal (send):
'''bash
./baby1 [send_port] [recv_port]


#run 2nd terminal (recive):
'''bash
./baby1 [recv_port] [send_port]

#USE  SAME PORT NUMBER FOR [recv_port]&[send_port]** 
#ex. ./baby1 5000 5001  &   ./baby1 5001 5000



#program 3rd:

##this progarm can run in multiple terminal they show in first terminal other system are online


#baby2.c

#compile first:
'''bash
gcc baby2.c -o baby2


#run this file more then 1  terminal
'''bash
./baby2
